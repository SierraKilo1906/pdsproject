    "## Motivation - Why predict energy demand? <a name = \"Motivation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservation of energy and energy management for both environmental and economic factors is an age old problem. Using predicted energy demand, utilities can manage generation and peak load shaving techniques. However, inaccurate predictions can lead to surplus generation, or worse still, energy deficits. Additionally, the advent of renewable energy generation has led to application of hourly load predictions for demand response programs and associated monetary transactions. Energy demand prediction has implications in the renewable energy sector, as well as for energy infrastructure system development, such as the design or planning of microgrids with the availability of more granular, neighborhood specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we explore the difference in accuracy as a result of using different regression methods. \n"

The correlation value plotted in each cell of the grid is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient value for the corresponding pair of features. By looking at this grid, we can see that there is no strong linear correlation between any of the features and the demand.
